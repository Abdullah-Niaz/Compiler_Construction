# Compiler Construction 📘⚙️

Welcome to the **Compiler Construction** repository!
This repository documents everything we learn about **compiler construction** throughout the semester. It will serve as a central place for lecture notes, assignments, projects, and implementation exercises.

---

## 📖 Overview

Compiler construction is a fundamental area of computer science that focuses on how high-level programming languages are translated into machine-executable code. In this course, we will explore the **theory, design, and implementation** of compilers, moving step by step through the major phases of compilation.

This repository aims to:

* Organize all course-related materials.
* Provide clear explanations for each compiler phase.
* Implement hands-on examples in different programming languages (likely **C/C++/Java/Python**, depending on course requirements).
* Act as a reference guide for future learning or revision.

## 🏗️ Phases of a Compiler We Will Cover

1. **Lexical Analysis (Scanner)**

   * Tokenization of input source code.
   * Designing a lexical analyzer using **Finite Automata**.
   * Tools: Regular Expressions, Lex/Flex.

2. **Syntax Analysis (Parser)**

   * Checking if token sequences follow grammar rules.
   * Context-Free Grammars (CFGs).
   * Parsing techniques:

     * Top-Down (LL parsers).
     * Bottom-Up (LR parsers).
   * Tools: Yacc/Bison.

3. **Semantic Analysis**

   * Ensuring correctness of meaning in code (e.g., type checking).
   * Symbol tables and scope handling.
   * Detecting semantic errors.

4. **Intermediate Code Generation**

   * Converting high-level constructs into an **Intermediate Representation (IR)**.
   * Abstract Syntax Trees (AST).
   * Three-address code (TAC).

5. **Code Optimization**

   * Improving intermediate code for efficiency.
   * Peephole optimization, loop optimization, dead code elimination.

6. **Code Generation**

   * Translating optimized IR into target machine code.
   * Instruction selection, register allocation.

7. **Error Handling & Recovery**

   * Handling lexical, syntax, and semantic errors.
   * Error recovery strategies.

* Implement different compiler phases step by step.
* Build a **working mini-compiler** for a simple programming language.
* Analyze and optimize code like real-world compilers.
